# comp.1501.bugs

Create issues in this repo regarding issues with COMP1501 drills, quizzes (practice and real), and assignments. I'm trying to improve the quality of the materials, and all help is appreciated!

As a way of showing my appreciation, I'll give out 1 "turn one late drill to on-time" bonus for the first person to report a bug or suggestion for improvement that I deem needs to be addressed. You can trade these bonuses in at the end of the semester; if you have more than you need, I'll let you trade them in for 0.15% for each extra one you have - up to a reasonable maximum. (I'm thinking 2% or so.)

This is really just a fledgling idea and is bound to start off a bit rough around the edges. Your patience while it gets tweaked is appreciated.
